This leads to a new round of growth in AI. #.\n # Transcript ID: 22.0 #: content: # The 2010s saw the rise of digital virtual assistants. #.\n # Transcript ID: 23.0 #: content: # Assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google utilize natural language processing to act as a convenient source of information for users, doing many of the tasks a human assistant would. #.\n # Transcript ID: 24.0 #: content: # Virtual assistants like these are the future of AI. They are controlling autonomous cars and taking a physical form as a robot. #.\n # Transcript ID: 25.0 #: content: # Artificial intelligence has come a long way since Alan Turing's idea in a hypothetical paper, and it will continue into the future driving cars, walking around in everyday life, and more. #.",
